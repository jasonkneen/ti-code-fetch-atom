# Titanium Code Fetch Package

Fetches sample code from [http://github.com/jasonkneen/ti-code-fetch](http://github.com/jasonkneen/ti-code-fetch)

To use, simply edit a Titanium JavaScript file, type in one of the templates available so if you wanted to load the "http.js" template, just type:

```
http
```

or the "open-camera.js" template:

```
open camera
```

then select the text and hit the shortcut key -- and it'll be replaced with the code sample.
